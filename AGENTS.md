# Agent Rules (Codex)

This file defines project-specific rules for Codex/agents working in this repo.

## Living Roadmap Is The Source Of Truth

- Always treat `docs/roadmap.md` as the canonical "overall plan".
- At the end of any task/feature/bugfix where you would normally say "done":
  - Update `docs/roadmap.md` to reflect reality.
  - Mark checklist items complete with a completion date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
  - Update "Current Status" (Now/Next/Blockers) if it changed.
  - Add a link to any new `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` documents, and optionally the PR/commit.
- If a change introduces a new risk/blocker (e.g. infra/domain/SSL), add it to the "Blockers / Risks" section.
